**üîê Advanced Password Generator with GUI**
**Project Overview**
This project is an Advanced Password Generator built using Python's Tkinter (or PyQt) for the graphical user interface (GUI). The tool generates secure passwords based on customizable criteria, allowing users to create strong passwords that meet modern security standards.
The application is designed with both usability and security in mind, making it easy to generate passwords while adhering to best practices for password creation.

**Features**

Customizable Password Complexity: Users can generate passwords with combinations of: Uppercase and lowercase letters,Numbers,Special characters (symbols).
Security Rules Compliance: Ensures that generated passwords follow best practices for strength and complexity, including minimum length and randomness.
Clipboard Integration: One-click copying of the generated password to the clipboard for easy use.
Character Exclusion: Users can exclude specific characters if needed (e.g., to avoid ambiguity between similar characters like 'O' and '0').
User-friendly GUI: Intuitive design makes it easy to adjust password length, select character types, and generate a password in seconds.

**Key Concepts and Challenges Addressed**

Randomization: Secure random generation of characters from different character sets (letters, numbers, symbols).
User Input Validation: Validation of user input, including password length and the inclusion of required character types.
Security Rules: Implementation of strong password guidelines, ensuring the generated passwords are difficult to guess or crack.
Clipboard Integration: Seamless copying of the generated password directly to the clipboard for user convenience.
Customization: Advanced options for customizing the password generation process, including the ability to exclude specific characters.
